#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

### TO RUN SERVER
open a terminal and change directories to mws-restaurant-stage-3
enter "node server" 


### TO RUN WEBSITE 
I used Google's "Web Server for Chrome" and directed it to my root directory for this project. Make sure the "Automatically show index.html" is checked. Click the local host link to open the website in the browser. Please ignore the dist folder. Run from the root of the project

### IMPORTANT NOTES!!!
Because an offline review couldn't be assigned an id right away, I used "createdAt" as my keypath for my databases. Unfortunately the servers premade reviews are all listed with the same createdAt value which causes a conflict when putting them into storage. For this reason you'll only see one cached review from the original posts. Rest assured, all other posts you make work just fine!
